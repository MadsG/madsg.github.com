					<p>Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower than humans can.<br> The wet nose is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell.<br> Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture<br> by air currents.</p>

				<h2 class="Article2-Title">Cats Have Better Tongues</h2>
					<p>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their coats. The cat's<br> tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers long, which are called<br> papillae. These are quite rigid, as they contain keratin. These spines allow cats to groom<br> themselves by licking their fur, with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush.</p>
